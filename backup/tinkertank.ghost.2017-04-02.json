Who are we?","slug":"so-who-are-we","markdown":"Making. Tinkering. STEAM. Makerspace. Project Leadership Learning. Heard any of these before? It’s likely you’ve heard a politician talking about its importance, or maybe you’ve seen a robotics program promoting these ideas. Google is one of the most avid proponents of these terms. But… uh. What do they mean? Why are they so important? What is it? \n\nGlad you asked! They’re the reason law makers and educational leaders are so excited about these concepts – and it’s not just because they get to write more syllabus points for kids to work through. People are excited because for the first time in a while (maybe ever…) education might actually be made fun. Taking pleasure in what you learn about is limitlessly better than being forced to learn something they have no ownership of. How is it better? Well apart from the obvious – that kids will retain more by learning about what they enjoy, it’s better for their life skills. \n\nBefore we get into all that stuff – let’s cover the initial question; what is STEM, STEAM, tinkering, makerspaces etc.?  These are not new concepts necessarily – Making and Tinkering is what inventors have been doing for centuries, nay, millennia. It’s the process of creating, experimenting and improving ideas to solve a problem. These are the skills that created and formed the most successful, inspirational and impactful minds in history. Henry Ford was a maker and a tinkerer – he because revolutionary because he got his hands dirty. Leonardo Da Vinci was a genius – not because he knew how to write great essays or copy off a while-board; he is revered because he created, failed, tinkered again and made something brilliant. He didn’t learn by ‘learning’ he learnt by doing.\n\nMore recently, the idea of the Makerspace came to be – I assume this was created by someone who realised that school sucks and needs an update… or someone who thought – ‘I need a couch.

Tinkering. STEAM. Makerspace. Project Leadership Learning. Heard any of these before? It’s likely you’ve heard a politician talking about its importance, or maybe you’ve seen a robotics program promoting these ideas. Google is one of the most avid proponents of these terms. But… uh. What do they mean? Why are they so important? What is it? </p>\n\n<p>Glad you asked! They’re the reason law makers and educational leaders are so excited about these concepts – and it’s not just because they get to write more syllabus points for kids to work through. People are excited because for the first time in a while (maybe ever…) education might actually be made fun. Taking pleasure in what you learn about is limitlessly better than being forced to learn something they have no ownership of. How is it better? Well apart from the obvious – that kids will retain more by learning about what they enjoy, it’s better for their life skills. </p>\n\n<p>Before we get into all that stuff – let’s cover the initial question; what is STEM, STEAM, tinkering, makerspaces etc.?  These are not new concepts necessarily – Making and Tinkering is what inventors have been doing for centuries, nay, millennia. It’s the process of creating, experimenting and improving ideas to solve a problem. These are the skills that created and formed the most successful, inspirational and impactful minds in history. Henry Ford was a maker and a tinkerer – he because revolutionary because he got his hands dirty. Leonardo Da Vinci was a genius – not because he knew how to write great essays or copy off a while-board; he is revered because he created, failed, tinkered again and made something brilliant. He didn’t learn by ‘learning’ he learnt by doing.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, the idea of the Makerspace came to be – I assume this was created by someone who realised that school sucks and needs an update… or someone who thought – ‘I need a couch. But not any couch. A couch that drives itself… to the fridge. All I need is a place to make one.’ – thus the makerspace was born. A makerspace is simply an area that people – adults, kids, particularly clever dogs and alike can come in and create things using equipment like laser cutters, 3D printers, robotics parts and an assortment of tools. A makerspace is in its name: it’s a space where you make things. </p>\n\n<p>Makerspaces have been popping up around the world – and engineers and enthusiasts have been creating cool things for years. Now, that movement needs to come to children. I have every belief that kids will create more amazing and incredible things in a makerspace than any adult. Why? Kids don’t know the word no… or can’t… or won’t… or any of the above – they have an opportunity in makerspaces to understand why… or how… or what if? TinkerTank is exactly that movement – giving kids the tools that adults tend to keep for themselves and showing them how to use it – but never telling them that ‘it’s impossible’ to do what they dream of.

I started when I was 15 years old - running workshops and basic classes as part of a robotics team - we were teaching students from ages 5 and up.\n\nBeing new and what some might consider naive - I didn't actually consider age to be a massive barrier to ability. That is to say - I figured if you taught kids, and explained things in an engaging and interested way - they'd eventually understand. Turns out, that's totally true! Disclaimer: young children often struggle to retain information for long periods of time - so whilst the information 'churn' is real, continual work and reinforcement meant that Kindergartners were using 'greater than' and 'less than' to use sensors, or using gear ratios to make drag racers or winches to pull objects. 5 year olds understood that the more rigid a moving construction is (like a pulley or drive system), the less friction is generated when put under strain. 5 year old's were sharing ideas, and coming up with projects that many would say are: beyond their age.\n\nThese kids were not only applying ideas beyond their age - they were testing, experimenting and learning in a project based environment that mean these kids were overcoming barriers themselves and not just following instruction.\n\nSo, how did these students start to understand these concepts? And why is this important? I mean, their only 5, right? Age 5 is when most children start being schooled - this is where stigmas, and learning styles and friendships and so much is formed. Doing it right now - is more important than doing it right later in life. On top of this - the WAY kids learn and the WAY they are taught from a young age is so important.\n\nEmotional maturity is something that comes with time, and so does the brain development required to retain large amounts of wrote learning. However, just like Dory in Finding Nemo - procedural knowledge (speaking, moving, interacting with people) is actually just fine, but declarative knowledge (recalling facts, names and other information) is weaker - this is the same with younger children. A young child at age 5 has the same amount of procedural knowledge and ability as a 14 or 15 year old kid. So how is teaching them things they'll forget useful? Well, teaching kids in a way that engages them, inspires them and makes them want to learn more, does several things:\n\nKids are no-longer having to wrote learn large amounts of information - they're discovering by doing.\nBy actually having teachers get kids to discover and learn things based on challenges they come across you get: high engagement from students; slightly higher information retention and...\nYour teaching kids to OVERCOME barriers to a task. As oppose to limiting what kids think and dream up - you can get them to learn for themselves. What may shock you is: these kids will do things you never think of yourself to overcome the issue they face. No longer are these kids being told 'No. You can't. Don't.' they're being asked 'why not try something different? What do you think?' and they're being told 'I don't know, let's look it up. I'm sure there's another way. Well done! You failed, and that's awesome'. Getting kids to think about alternatives, and encouraging them to overcome barriers is super powerful.\nNow, I mentioned failure in there as well: teaching kids to learn how to fail produces some epic results. No more is failure a reason to give up - it's a learning experience and reason to try again!\n\nSo next time you think about giving your kids something to do - try giving them a project and helping them do it, even if you don't know how yourself. Help them Google it, or keep trying things until it works. You'll start to raise children ready to tackle the unpredictable work, and ready to overcome challenge, not get shut down by it.\n\nStop saying 'you can't' or 'don't' or 'that's impossible' and start letting them learn and find out WHY something is the way it is. It'll make for a much more exciting childhood and a much more capable child!\n\nProject based learning is applicable across all areas of study - heck, it's exactly what adults do in the workplace - have a challenge - then solve it. TinkerTank does exactly that. It gives kids challenges and topics to work on - then helps them accomplish that; not by telling them what to do or think, but by encouraging them to think, helping them access the right resources and showing them that they are much smarter than anyone gives them credit for.\n\nIf you live in Sydney, try it for yourself, goto TinkerTank.com.au and book a course.

Julija has won multiple awards for her animation work, and has been nominated for Academy Awards. She has delivered lectures on animation at conferences around the world. Julija now works as a Curriculum writer, UX + App Designer and Arts Teacher. Her team was selected as a Startup Innovator by IBM in 2010. Recently her work was shortlisted for the Pollinator DataStart Project 2015 and a finalist in the EducationChangemakers Accelerator Program in Feb 2017. Julija is the \"Futurist\" and head Tinkerer at TinkerTank and loves every second of it.\n\n\n\n**James McArthur** : *Generalist* \n\nJames has been doing robotics since year 3 at school. Competing in several robotics competitions, and even winning the state LEGO Robotics Dance competition in year 4 – and has been really enthusiastic and passionate about STEAM education ever since. Now in university – continuing his passion for STEAM education at TinkerTank – creating courses, helping kids and making learning fun.\n\n**Nicholas McDowell** : *Software* \n\nNicholas is what we like to call a Serial-Entrepreneur with experience working with a diverse group of businesses — from Silicon Valley startups to the US Department of Defence. An inventor and tech-junkie at heart, on any given day you can find Nicholas ideating, developing, and testing innovative tech solutions to big and small problems. He dreams of one day surfing behind a (powerful) drone — we dare you to invent that one Nicholas!\n\n\n**Fred Westing** : *Robotics/Coding*\n\nOver the past eight years, Fred has been designing, programming and competing with robots at a national and international level. He believes robots are the future, and are inherently awesome — and we would have to agree. Fred is experienced in a wide array of programming languages and wants your kids to be prepared to design the software of tomorrow, which is why he is our expert coding Mentor.\n\n\n\n**Tijana Williams** : *Animation*\n\nFor Tijana, simply creating beautiful designs wasn't enough — she wanted to make them move too. With degrees in graphic design and animation, Tijana adores animation in all of its forms. With a special love for stop-motion animation, Tijana is excited to share her knowledge of this medium with the next generation of creative thinkers.\n\n\n\n**Stephanie Curro** : *Robotics*\n\nStephanie is a loud and proud girl in STEAM. She found robotics in year 5 after her Mum took her to her first class, and she’s been hooked ever since. She wants to empower the next generation of girls to become innovators and she works hard to inspire all the kids she teaches. She is currently completing her final year of schooling while competing on a FIRST Robotics Team at Macquarie University.\n\n\n\n**Gary Osborne** : *Design*\n\nGary is a self-taught cabinet and furniture maker with an interest in the restoration of historical military hardware. Gary's enthusiasm for taking things apart, investigating how they work, and then building them into something new, makes him the perfect teacher of our Break it Down class. Did someone order a life-sized slingshot?\n\n\n\n**Pippa May** : *Design*\n\nPippa is TinkerTank's walking Pinterest board; bursting with ideas for creative craft activities. With an Advanced Diploma of Fashion Design it is no wonder that Pippa's classes are hands-on, often textile focused, and include a sprinkling of design theory to boot. In Pippa's classes anything is possible.\n\n\n**Karen Hopkins** : *Design*\n\nAs a Producer/Director Karen spends her days running around with a camera capturing colourful content to turn into exciting online videos. She purchased her first video camera at age 15 and now 15+ years later, she is still creating videos. With seven years of American summer camp under her belt Karen loves teaching and working with kids. She is a Manly local who loves yoga, sunrise swims and trips to the farmers market.\n\n\n**Dragan** : *Intern*\n\nDragan is TinkerTank's youngest Mentor and resident MineCraft expert — he can literally answer any MineCraft question you have. When not teaching at TinkerTank Dragan can be found honing is craft with more MineCarft, as well as exploring code and animation. Dragan is a Manly local, keep an eye out for him skate-boarding down North Steyne!\n\n\n\n**Erik** : *Intern*\n\nErik has found lots of interest in Maths, Engineering, Science & Robotics and has learnt Coding in a week at TinkerTank. TinkerTank expands his capability of learning. He has been awarded with multiple awards of Science, Mathematics and Robotics. He has a wonderful family of four, his family includes a younger Brother, a Mum and Dad as well as himself. One day he hopes to code software for TinkerTank or work as an Engineer.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><strong>Mentors at TinkerTank</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Julija McDowell</strong> : <em>Founder + Futurist</em></p>\n\n<p>Worked for ILM, Lucas Film, Lucas Arts, Disney as a Lead animator and trainer in California for over 18 years.

Fred is experienced in a wide array of programming languages and wants your kids to be prepared to design the software of tomorrow, which is why he is our expert coding Mentor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tijana Williams</strong> : <em>Animation</em></p>\n\n<p>For Tijana, simply creating beautiful designs wasn't enough — she wanted to make them move too. With degrees in graphic design and animation, Tijana adores animation in all of its forms. With a special love for stop-motion animation, Tijana is excited to share her knowledge of this medium with the next generation of creative thinkers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stephanie Curro</strong> : <em>Robotics</em></p>\n\n<p>Stephanie is a loud and proud girl in STEAM. She found robotics in year 5 after her Mum took her to her first class, and she’s been hooked ever since. She wants to empower the next generation of girls to become innovators and she works hard to inspire all the kids she teaches. She is currently completing her final year of schooling while competing on a FIRST Robotics Team at Macquarie University.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gary Osborne</strong> : <em>Design</em></p>\n\n<p>Gary is a self-taught cabinet and furniture maker with an interest in the restoration of historical military hardware. Gary's enthusiasm for taking things apart, investigating how they work, and then building them into something new, makes him the perfect teacher of our Break it Down class. Did someone order a life-sized slingshot?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pippa May</strong> : <em>Design</em></p>\n\n<p>Pippa is TinkerTank's walking Pinterest board; bursting with ideas for creative craft activities. With an Advanced Diploma of Fashion Design it is no wonder that Pippa's classes are hands-on, often textile focused, and include a sprinkling of design theory to boot. In Pippa's classes anything is possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Karen Hopkins</strong> : <em>Design</em></p>\n\n<p>As a Producer/Director Karen spends her days running around with a camera capturing colourful content to turn into exciting online videos. She purchased her first video camera at age 15 and now 15+ years later, she is still creating videos. With seven years of American summer camp under her belt Karen loves teaching and working with kids. She is a Manly local who loves yoga, sunrise swims and trips to the farmers market.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dragan</strong> : <em>Intern</em></p>\n\n<p>Dragan is TinkerTank's youngest Mentor and resident MineCraft expert — he can literally answer any MineCraft question you have. When not teaching at TinkerTank Dragan can be found honing is craft with more MineCarft, as well as exploring code and animation. Dragan is a Manly local, keep an eye out for him skate-boarding down North Steyne!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Erik</strong> : <em>Intern</em></p>\n\n<p>Erik has found lots of interest in Maths, Engineering, Science &amp; Robotics and has learnt Coding in a week at TinkerTank. TinkerTank expands his capability of learning. He has been awarded with multiple awards of Science, Mathematics and Robotics. He has a wonderful family of four, his family includes a younger Brother, a Mum and Dad as well as himself. One day he hopes to code software for TinkerTank or work as an Engineer.</p>","amp":null,"image":"/content/images/2017/03/TinkerTank_Mentors.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":"TinkerTank Mentors","meta_description":null,"author_id":4,"created_at":"2017-03-23T04:59:26.000Z","created_by":4,"updated_at":"2017-03-31T22:31:30.000Z","updated_by":4,"published_at":"2017-03-23T21:02:14.000Z","published_by":4},{"id":15,"uuid":"94e54a47-a16c-4137-bc62-5541bd6e002e","title":"Don't be afraid.
